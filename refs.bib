	Abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the possibility to directly apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) to segmentation of brain tumor tissues. As input to the network, we use multi-channel intensity information from a small patch around each point to be labelled. Only standard intensity pre-processing is applied to the input data to account for scanner differences. No post-processing is applied to the output of the CNN. We report promising preliminary results on the high-grade training data from the BraTS 2013 challenge. Work for the final submission will include architecture modifications, parameter tuning and training on the BraTS 2014 training corpus.},
